    <description>After 4 years of self-suffering, we are expanding our experience by building a counseling platform that enables people to resolve issues efficiently. Not all issues can be resolved through ignorance, especially when they have a long history, for example, rejections. A short-term counseling can resolve these issues by helping you uncover matters that impact your mental health and find methods to help you cope and build resilience.</description>

    <description>On this platform, we help provide a method to connect counselors with those with a history of suffering from mental illness before and fight back, girl rejections and social shyness or a student suffering from placement rejections, those who have recovered from all of these will help you rise.</description>
